WELCOME TO **Project Uplâ†‘ft**!

INFORMATION
Uplift is a mobile crowdsourcing platform that makes it easy for a sick person's relatives and friends to help them out in whatever way they can. 
When it comes to colds and cancer alike, research shows that emotional support is crucial for one's recovery. 
Uplift connects a patient to a network of family and friends that allows even the smallest of gestures to reach them. 
Simply create a virtual room for your sick relative or friend and share the code with everyone they know. 
Family and friends can drop by to schedule a call, send a gift, leave a message, do an errand, or even just give a virtual hug to let the patient know they are in someone else's thoughts. 
Through Uplift, everyone is able to do their part to improve a patient's quality of life while providing them with a strong social support system.
